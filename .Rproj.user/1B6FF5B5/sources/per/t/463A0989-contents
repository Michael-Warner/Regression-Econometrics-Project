#We can find that there are two kinds of hotels: City hotel(79330) and Resort 
#hotel(40060);
#44224 bookings(37%) have been canceled;
#in 2016, hotels had the largest number of guests(56707) and they get the most 
#guests in the summer;
#people usually book a hotel online;
#a very small percentage(3.19%) of guests have previously booked these two hotels;
#most of the guests at these two hotels have breakfast reservations(BB:92310) 
#and have chosen room A(85994);
#most bookings donâ€™t require a deposit;
#most of the guests at the hotel are transient;
#the mean of adr(average daily rate) is 101.83 per night
